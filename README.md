## 🌱 Overview

**Regenerative Valuation Systems 1.0** is a public-domain framework to quantify and reward ecosystem health through a tri-tiered digital currency system. Anchored in verifiable ecological data, the system drives a regenerative economy by aligning human and technological incentives with biospheric vitality.

### Vision

A world where:  
* ✨ **Explorers** map and document biodiversity.  
* 🌾 **Regenerators** restore degraded ecosystems.  
* 🛡 **Guardians** steward healthy ecosystems into the future.

## 📈 Core Features

### 🔟 Tri-Tiered Currency Framework

**1. 🧬 EXPLORERs — Discovery & Documentation**  
* Rewards collection and verification of ecosystem data.  
* Focus: Microbial, fungal, faunal, floral biodiversity surveys; soil & water tests.  
* Provides foundational data for ecological valuation.  

**2. 🌾 REGENs — Restoration & Recovery**  
* Rewards measurable improvements in ecosystem health.  
* Focus: Soil carbon increases, water infiltration/retention, species return, habitat connectivity.  
* Quantified through geo-tagged, time-stamped before/after data and ecological models.  

**3. 🛡 GUARDIANs — Stewardship & Continuity**  
* Rewards long-term care and ecosystem resilience.  
* Focus: Sustained biodiversity, microbial activity, no net degradation.  
* Includes time-weighted multipliers for continuous stewardship.  

### 💼 Ecological Debit Accounting
* Tracks ecosystem degradation and restoration obligations.  
* Holds extractive actors accountable through regeneration bonds.  
* Enables rebalancing of ecological debts using the tri-tier system.  

### 🔬 Biodiversity & Ecosystem Metrics
* Multi-trophic biodiversity indexing (microbes, insects, flora, fauna).  
* Functional ecosystem health indicators (carbon, moisture, nutrient cycling).  
* Integration of remote sensing (NDVI, drone imaging, satellites).  
* Oracles ensure data verifiability and decentralized consensus.

## 📅 Getting Started

1. **Explore the Framework**  
   * Read the [WIPO publication (WO2024155705)](https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2024155705) and [Public Domain Declaration](public_domain_declaration.pdf).  
   * Browse [Darryl’s ecological research](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Darryl-Nicke-Ii/research) for open-source studies.  

2. **Implement Locally**  
   * Set up ecosystem survey protocols (e.g., soil microbe sampling to earn EXPLORER tokens).  
   * Define reward schemas for EXPLORERs, REGENs, and GUARDIANs (e.g., tokens for carbon sequestration).  
   * Build local DAOs or governance councils for validation.  

3. **Connect to Global Commons**  
   * Share validated data on decentralized marketplaces, retaining **data sovereignty**.  
   * Trade value while owning earned currency and stewardship rights.  

4. **Contribute to Development**  
   * Fork the repository, suggest improvements, and build tools.  
   * Submit pull requests and case studies (e.g., farmland restoration pilots).

## 🌍 Guiding Principles

* **Verifiability is Vital**: All health claims must be independently validated with consensus.  
* **Open Access & Interoperability**: Regenerative systems must remain free and forkable.  
* **Stewardship over Ownership**: Value belongs with local stewards, with **individual rights to earned currency** and **data sovereignty**.  
* **Earth First**: Incentives prioritize biospheric flourishing through **objective value creation**.
